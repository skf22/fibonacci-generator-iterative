A simple practice function that generates a fibonacci sequence given two parameter inputs, namely i) sequence 
(an array comprising two numbers forming the start of the fibonacci sequence), and ii) length (the length of
the intended fibonacci sequence array).  

The solution is implemented iteratively via while loop.
